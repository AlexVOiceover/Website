# Website

This website is part of the workshops needed for applying for the FAO Founders and Coders Skills Bootcamp programme.

On the About me section I describe what is my current ocupation. I use flex containers that are collapsed by default, so they can have a look to the whole website easier.
Cliking on the tabs the containers will show the whole content.

For the "Why move to a web developer career" I used the same elemnts as before.

In the "What I learned so far" section I wanted to replicate the aesthetics of the previous sections but using girds instead flex containers. I wanted to include everything in one single "card" to showcase the different distribution of the images and text along the different rows.
In this section you will find links to the previous workshops, both the code and the deployments.
