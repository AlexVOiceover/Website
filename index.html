                        <article><p>I have been working as a sound engineer for over 12 years. I started simply by recording and editing my own voiceovers, and now I have produced TV commercials, movie trailers, video games, and more.</p>
                            <p>One of the things I like most about sound engineering is that it combines both artistic and technical requirements. In terms of software, it is necessary to be skilled, but as a consumer of software, not as a creator, and that is the biggest deficiency for me. In terms of hardware, I love machines, in addition to the many possibilities for modding, vintage markets, or technological novelties.</p>

                        <article><p>All my life I have been involved with music. I studied piano and singing, and participated in various African percussion bands.</p>
                            <p>From all of that experience, I took advantage of the knowledge of rhythm, voice technique (breathing, intonation, cadence...) for a new passion: voiceover and dubbing.</p>
                            <p>After many years, I managed to establish myself in the market, but recent changes in the industry and, above all, the emergence of AI for voice generation, have caused the volume of work to plummet.</p>

                                <p>For these reasons, I would like to return to programming, and although I do not rule out PM tasks, I would love to develop my more technical skills.</p></article>
