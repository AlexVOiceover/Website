                            <article><p>I have been working as a sound engineer for over 12 years. I started simply by recording and editing my own voiceovers, and now I have produced TV commercials, movie trailers, video games, and more.</p>
                                <p> One of the things I like most about sound engineering is that it combines both artistic and technical requirements. In terms of software, it is necessary to be skilled, but as a consumer of software, not as a creator, and that is the biggest deficiency for me. In terms of hardware, I love machines, in addition to the many possibilities for modding, vintage markets, or technological novelties.</p>

                        <article>As a sound engineer, I love working with both software and hardware to produce high-quality sound. I find satisfaction in the technical aspects of my work and the attention to detail required. I stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments and enjoy experimenting with customized setups, particularly vintage equipment. Ultimately, I am dedicated to delivering the best possible sound for each project I take on.</article>
